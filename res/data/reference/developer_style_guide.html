<h1>Development Style Guide</h1>
<p>Obviously everyone has their own style of programming, and tools such as
perl-tidy can help but here is a list of things that all developers, regardless
of language, should adhere to in order to keep the Fonality code base
consistent.

Some of these are taken from the perl style guide on perldoc.perl.org, others
are to be in-line with our current code.</p>
<p>Run perl programs under <code><strong>-w</strong></code> at all times. You may explicitly
turn it off using the <code><strong>no</strong> warnings</code> pragma.

You should always run under <code><strong>use</strong> strict</code>.

<ul>
    <li>4-column indent, replace tabs with spaces.</li>
    <li>Opening curly on next line as keyword (to be consistent with current
    code).</li>
    <li>Ending curly should line up vertically with the starting keyword.</li>
    <li>Space before the opening curly of a multi-line BLOCK.</li>
    <li>One-line BLOCK may be put on one line, including curlies.</li>
    <li>No space before the semicolon.</li>
    <li>Space around most operators.</li>
    <li>Space around a "complex" subscript (inside brackets).</li>
    <li>Blank lines between chunks that do different things.</li>
    <li>Uncuddled elses.</li>
    <li>No space between function name and its opening parenthesis.</li>
    <li>Space after each comma.</li>
    <li>Long lines broken after an operator (except and and or ).</li>
    <li>Space after last parenthesis matching on current line.</li>
    <li>Line up corresponding items vertically.</li>
    <li>Omit redundant punctuation as long as clarity doesn't suffer.</li>
    <li>Document your code with understandable comments and use Pod formatting
    in a consistent way. 
    <ul>
        <li>Use C&lt;&gt; for function, variable, and module names. Function is
        more readabile with parentheses after the name, e.g.
        <code>function().</code></li>
        <li>Use B&lt;&gt; for command names like
        <code><strong>cat</strong></code> or <code><strong>grep</strong></code>.</li>
        <li>Use F&lt;&gt; or C&lt;&gt; for file names.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Always call a module-level method using the complete package name. e.g.
    Fap::ModuleName::MethodName</li>
    <li>Return <code><strong>undef</strong></code> instead of
    <code><strong>die</strong></code> for methods executed through the web. die
    will result in an Error 500.</li>
    <li>Create unit tests using Test::More whenever possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other things to think about:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Just because you <em>CAN</em> do something a particular way doesn't mean
    you <em>SHOULD</em> do it that way. Go for readability and understandability
    over complexity.</li>
    <li>Don't muddy the code trying to exit a loop at the top or bottom. Use the
    <code><strong>last</strong></code> operator in the middle if appropriate, and "outdent"
    it a little to make it more visible.</li>
    <li>Don't be afriad to use loop labels. They enhance readability and allow
    for multi-level lop breaks.</li>
    <li>Avoid using <code><strong>grep(), map()</strong></code> or `backticks`
    in a void context, that is, when you just throw away their return values.
    They all have return values so use them.</li>
    <li>Variable names should be all lowercase with underscores to separate
    words. CONSTANTS should be in all caps. Avoid obscure abbreviations to
    improve readability. e.g. $bundle_license, $ITERATIONS</li>
    <li>Package names being with a Capital and do not use underscores. e.g.
    Fap::ConfLoader</li>
    <li>Use the /x modifier on complex regular expressions to include
    whitespace.</li>
    <li>Use here documents instead of repeated
    <code><strong>print()</strong></code> statements</li>
    <li>Always check the return codes of system calls.</li>
    <li>Think about reusability. Generalize your code. Consider writing a module
    or object class.</li>
</ul>
