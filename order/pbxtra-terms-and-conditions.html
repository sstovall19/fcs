<p> </p>
<p>1. ORDERS </p>
<p>Customer's signature (electronic or physical) of an&nbsp;estimate is a non-cancellable Order by Customer for Product. Orders are not binding until accepted by Fonality, in its sole discretion. Once an Order is accepted by Fonality, it may be changed or cancelled ONLY with the written consent of Fonality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. PAYMENTS</p>
<p>2.1&nbsp;All&nbsp;prices are F.O.B. Fonality's Los Angeles, California&nbsp;facility. The full purchase price for the Product is due before shipment unless otherwise agreed in writing by Fonality. Prices may not include any customs duties, sales, use, value added, excise, federal, state, local, public utility, universal service or other similar taxes, freight, activation fees, toll charges,&nbsp;duties or imposts (&ldquo;Fees&rdquo;).&nbsp;All such Fees shall be paid by Customer and will be added to any amounts otherwise charged to Customer, and Customer will be liable for and will pay in full all such amounts. If payment is made via credit card, Customer authorizes Fonality to charge the&nbsp;Customer's credit card for all charges arising from Customer's purchase&nbsp;of the Product. Customer agrees to notify Fonality of any change to the credit card information including, but not limited to, changes in account number, expiration date or billing address. Otherwise, Customer agrees to pay all amounts due upon receipt of invoice. Balances not paid within 10 days of the due date are subject to a late-payment charge of the greater of 1.5% of the outstanding balance, or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is higher. Fonality shall not be responsible for any third party costs incurred by Customer for exceeding credit limit, insufficient funds or other reasons.&nbsp;Customer waives the right to process chargebacks on their credit card for Fonality purchases. Notwithstanding any partial payment by Customer, title to goods shipped shall remain with Fonality until the entire price has been paid; and, if Customer defaults in the payment of any charges hereunder when due, Fonality may remove and repossess any and all such goods delivered, terminate access to any remotely hosted services, and cause expiration of any software licenses delivered in conjunction with such goods, in addition to any other legal remedies it may have.</p>
<p>2.2&nbsp;All purchases related to the Product contained in the Order, including but not limited to Fees are non-refundable. Upon receipt of an Order from Customer that is accepted by Fonality, we will begin the process of setting up the Product for you. Therefore, once an Order has been placed, and accepted by Fonality, no refund will be given of any activation fees, setup charges, or other fees incurred, regardless of whether or not such Product was kept or used.</p>
<p>2.3&nbsp;Customer must dispute any charges for the Product in writing within thirty (30) days of the date of the charge by Fonality. After thirty (30) days from the date of the charge, Customer waives any objection and further recourse. Written statements disputing charges must be sent to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Billing@fonality.com">Billing@fonality.com</a>&nbsp;. The&nbsp;existence of a validly filed dispute shall in no way relieve Customer of its obligation to pay all amounts billed by Fonality, including any disputed amounts.</p>
